An exception to this license are the external software-libs, used by ZfExtended. 
If you use them, you must follow and apply their specific licenses. Therefore they 
are not part of the ZfExtended software package and not part of the ZfExtended 
git-repository.

These external software-libs are:

- the MittagQI-fork of Horde_Text_Diff. It is used by the diff-Version of the translate5 export,
which is able to track the changes made in segments. If you use this functionality, you
need the Horde_Text_Diff-package. Horde is licensed under LGPL v. 2.1. A copy of 
the LGPL v. 2.1 you can find at http://www.horde.org/licenses/lgpl21

- the MittagQI-fork of restful-zend-framework. restful-zend-framework is 
Copyright (c) 2011 Code in Chaos Inc. http://www.codeinchaos.com. In our opinion 
it's license is compareable to a free-bsd-license (no warranty or responsibilty 
for this opionion in any way by MittagQI or Marc Mittag in person). You find this 
license at https://github.com/MittagQI/restful-zend-framework/blob/master/LICENSE
Without this software-lib "translate5 PHP Server" will not work.
